        <li><h1>ISO/OSI LAYER</h1></li>
            <P>OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It has been developed by ISO – ‘International Organization of Standardization‘, in the year 1984. It is a 7 layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform. All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe. </P>

        <li><h1>TCP/IP LAYER</h1></li>
        <p>The OSI Model we just looked at is just a reference/logical model. It was designed to describe the functions of the communication system by dividing the communication procedure into smaller and simpler components. But when we talk about the TCP/IP model, it was designed and developed by Department of Defense (DoD) in 1960s and is based on standard protocols. It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains four layers, unlike seven layers in the OSI model. The layers are:
            <ol>
               <li>Process/Application Layer</li> 
               <li>Host-to-Host/Transport Layer</li>
               <li>Internet Layer</li>
               <li>Network Access/Link Layer</li>
            </ol>
